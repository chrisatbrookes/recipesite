A drop cap is so called because drops down below the line in which it would normally be restricted. The amount of drop can vary but is usually defined by the number of lines. The illustration here shows a **drop** of 3 lines.

The way that the words to the right of this single character wrap or are offset is an important consideration and how this adjustment is made will depend on the platform (web or print). It also is worth considering which word will start the paragraph too, because starting with the letter **I** may look odd and confuse the reader.

## How do we achieve drop caps for print

As you may expect, I am going to talk about *InDesign* here.
