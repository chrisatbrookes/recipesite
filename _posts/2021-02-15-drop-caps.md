A drop cap is so called because drops down below the line in which it would normally be restricted. The amount of drop can vary but is usually defined by the number of lines. The illustration here shows a **drop** of 3 lines.

The way that the words to the right of this single character wrap or are offset is an important consideration and how this adjustment is made will depend on the platform (web or print)
